# Polynomial Constant Solver

This project contains a Node.js script that calculates the constant term 'c' of a polynomial given a set of points on its curve. It uses the Lagrange Interpolation formula at x=0.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed.
2. Clone the repository or download the `solve.js` file.
3. Open your terminal in the project directory and run the following command:
   ```bash
   node solve.js
